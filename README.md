#  Identify key factors associated with heart attacks

Project title:
My research questionis: Identify key factors associated with heart attacks.
The data is from 2022 and was collected by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The data was collected in all 50 US states and three U.S. territories.
In total around 435000 surveyed people are in my cleaned sample.

Motivation:
According to the U.S Department of Health and Human Services every year, about 805.000 people in the United States have a heart attack, this means one person every 40 seconds. Many hearattacks are subtle and never detected, but still cause serious damage. 
With my Topic wanted to look into factors, which could potentially lead to an identification of a risk group and therefore an early detection and prevention of developing Heart_Attacks when paid attention to. 

The objective is to gather insights into risk factors that lead to heart attacks. 
To do so, I want to look into distributions of factors and the relationship between the features and the target variable heart attack.

I followed the instructions to not include any boxplots and make it as simple as possible, staying within timelimit of 7 minutes.

Conclusion/ Findings of the project:


Identify key factors associated with target value hadheartattack.
    
Following factors seem to have a correlation to the target value
        For bmi, the extreme values seem to have higher risks of heartattaks
        Group "Never smoked" has significantly lower hadheartattack percentage, than all the other groups, who have smoked or are smoking.
        For age the correlation is clearly visible. The higher the agegroup, the higher the amount of heart attacks.
        The percentage of hadheartattack is higher for people without physical activities.
                                                                                                                                            There might be a higher proportion of individuals who had both angina and a heart attack compared to those did not have angina but a heartattack.
